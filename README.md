## What is this?
	So eventually, my friends and I will be playing The Witcher TTRPG. And my biggest problem with TTRPGs has been congruency betweeen sessions and the lack of any sort of persistance outside phone apps or literally keeping track on a piece of paper. This app (eventually) will allow you to create and store characters for playsessions, and save their state between sessions.
